**Sales Performance Analysis Dashboard (Excel Project)**

This project is inspired by a dashboard demo created by **Daniel on YouTube**. I recreated the project from scratch and added my own improvements to better understand how sales performance varies across **products**, **regions**, and **customer segments**.

Using **Excel** for both **data cleaning** and **visualization**, I built an interactive dashboard that uncovers key business insights and highlights trends that can support better decision-making.

## 📊 **Key Insights**

* **Consumer Segment** leads all others with **$1.16M in total sales**.
* **Technology Category** is the top-performing product line with **$828K** in revenue.
* **The West Region** dominates sales, and **California alone contributed $457K**.
* **2012** recorded the lowest annual revenue, with significant dips in **March, June, July, and September**.
* **2014** achieved the highest revenue at **$733K**, showing strong year-over-year improvement.

These insights help businesses understand where revenue is coming from, what’s driving performance changes, and where to target future strategies.
